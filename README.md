# Sampling
- Creditcard_data.csv contains the dataset.
- Different Machine Learning models are applied with different sampling techniques to check which model gives higher accuracy on which model.
- result.csv contains output matrix.

# Sampling techniques used
- **Simple Random Sampling**- Pick the sample at random
- **Systematic Sampling**- Samples are chosen at random intervals.
- **Stratified Sampling**- The population is divided into subgroups or strata based on a certain characteristic. Individual elements from a sub-population can be randomly selected.
- **Cluster Sampling**- The entire population is divided into smaller groups and then a random sample of these clusters is selected. The sample size is then selected on the basis of sample size.
- **Convenience Sampling**- Sample is selected as per Convenience.

# Machine Models used
- XGB
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- KNN
